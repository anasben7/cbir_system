# cbir_system


<p>This project implements Image Search Engine through CBIR (content based image retrieval) approach with User feedback.
CBIR approach pays greater attention to global and local information, such as color, shape and texture.</p>
<p>The system show the user a sample of pictures and asks for rating from the user. Using these ratings, system re-queries and re-calcul the weight of each descriptor and repeats until the right images are found.</p>
